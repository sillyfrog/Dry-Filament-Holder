# Dry-Filament-Holder

The source for various parts I used to make a filament holder that keeps the filament in a container to keep it dry. See here for more details: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2980799

The core of the design is from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1806139 - with a minor modification to hold it in the centre, as per  https://www.tinkercad.com/things/h5vRmStXGgS .

The source of the parts are:

*Container feet*: These go under the container to keep it level.

*Screw joiner holder*: I couldn't easily get an M5 screw long enough to go from one side to the other, so this holds 2 nuts, and you can screw in a shorter M5 screw from each side.

*Pusher inner*: When trying to get the bearings into the final print, I found it required a bit of force, and to get them recessed, I didn't have anything that would apply an even force. So this basic part will line up with the center of the bearing, and allow you to push it in (I used a vice).
